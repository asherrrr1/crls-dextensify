### DO NOT PRESS OKAY YET

step 6: get ready to quickly switch tabs. press okay, quickly switch to the extension tab you have open. once you do that, SPAM the switch i showed you above FAST within 5 seconds of pressing okay

step 7: eventually your chromebook will freeze for 30 seconds - 2 minutes, something like that. Wait for it to come back

step 8: youre done! go to any site and it will be unblocked

useful sites: https://swatchseries.is (any show for free) (tips: have control+w ready, when you click something and it opens a new tab, insantly press control+w to close the tab)

this will probably be patched soon, looking into more methods for the future. enjoy!
